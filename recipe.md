1. Add the sugar and melted butter in a bowl and mix together.

2. Sift the flour, baking powder, vanilla and salt together and add to the sugar and butter mixture. Add the chocolate chips at this stage.

3. Once you get a dough texture, add the egg and knead.

4. Spread some butter onto a baking tray. Take some of the dough, roll into ball then flatten a little. Keep them on the small side as they spread out during baking. Also, don’t keep cookies close to each other otherwise they will get stuck together.

5. Place in the oven and bake at 160C for 10-20 mins. The bigger the cookies, the longer they’ll take to cook. They’re ready when the edges are a bit golden.
